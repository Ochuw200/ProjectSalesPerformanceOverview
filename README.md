# Sales Data and Subscription Trends Analysis

This is my final project documentation while learning data analysis from LITA. This repository contains data and queries for analyzing sales performance for a retail store and customer subscription trends. It covers various codes such as total sales, customer acquisition, subscription trends, and regional revenues.

## Contents
- **Data**: Datasets containing sales data and customer subscription data.
- **Queries**: Excel,powerbi and SQL programs were used for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- **Data Analysis programs used**
- **Prerequisites**
- **Projects**: Project 1 (Retail store sale data), Project 2 (Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service data) 
- **Reports**: Summary reports.

## Getting Started

### Data Analysis Program Used 
- SQL: Structured Query Language 
- Power BI: Power Business Intelligence 
- Microsoft Excel

  ### Prerequisites 
- A compartable computer/laptop
- Browser

### Projects 
This repository contains two data analysis projects focused on sales data and customer segmentation for a subscription service. Each project involves data exploration, SQL analysis, and Power BI dashboard creation.

## Project 1: Sales Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project involves analyzing sales data to uncover insights about product performance, regional trends, and monthly sales totals. The analysis is conducted in Excel, SQL, and Power BI.

## Instructions
1. Excel
Perform Initial Exploration: Use pivot tables to summarize total sales by product, region, and month.
Calculate Metrics:
Use Excel formulas to calculate the average sales per product and total revenue by region.
Create Additional Reports: Generate any other interesting reports that highlight key sales insights.
2. SQL
Hint: Load the dataset into your SQL Server environment to write and validate your queries.

Write SQL queries to extract key insights based on the following questions:

Retrieve the total sales for each product category.
Find the number of sales transactions in each region.
Identify the highest-selling product by total sales value.
Calculate total revenue per product.
Calculate monthly sales totals for the current year.
Find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.
Calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.
Identify products with no sales in the last quarter.
3. Power BI
Dashboard Creation: Create a Power BI dashboard that visualizes the insights found in Excel and SQL.
Include a sales overview, top-performing products, and regional breakdowns.

## Project 2: Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service
Project Overview
This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify segments and trends. The goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types, and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. The final deliverable is a Power BI dashboard.

## Instructions
1. Excel
Analyze Customer Data: Use pivot tables to find subscription patterns.
Calculate Metrics:
Calculate the average subscription duration and identify the most popular subscription types.
Create Additional Reports: Generate any other interesting reports that highlight customer behavior.
2. SQL
Hint: Load the dataset into your SQL Server environment to write and validate your queries.

Write SQL queries to extract key insights based on the following questions:

Retrieve the total number of customers from each region.
Find the most popular subscription type by the number of customers.
Identify customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months.
Calculate the average subscription duration for all customers.
Find customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months.
Calculate total revenue by subscription type.
Identify the top 3 regions by subscription cancellations.
Find the total number of active and canceled subscriptions.
3. Power BI
Dashboard Creation: Build a Power BI dashboard that visualizes key customer segments, cancellations, and subscription trends.
Include slicers for interactive analysis of customer data.

### Reports 
This project analyzes retail sales data to uncover insights on top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly trends. Using Excel for data exploration, SQL for querying key metrics, and Power BI for visualization, it delivers an interactive dashboard showcasing sales overviews, product performance, and regional contributions.
